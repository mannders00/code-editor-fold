# code-editor-fold
A code editor which includes header and code folding for Standard Notes.

It functions exactly the same as the [official code editor](https://github.com/standardnotes/code-editor) provided by Standard Notes, but incorporates [folding features](https://codemirror.net/demo/folding.html) provided by CodeMirror.

It also adds a few new fold-specific shortcuts, for quick folding on the fly.

```
CTRL+F: "fold"
CTRL+W: "unfold all"
CTRL+Q: "fold all"
```

Keep in mind this is still an an unofficial editor and unexpected issues may arise.
